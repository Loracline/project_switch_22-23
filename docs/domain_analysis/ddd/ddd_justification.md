# DDD justification

The justification for creating different aggregates in the project was based on various factors, such as:

Separation of responsibilities: By separating User Stories into one aggregate and the Product Backlog with the Project 
into another, specific responsibilities can be delegated to teams or individuals responsible for each of these elements.
This can help ensure that tasks and activities are performed more efficiently, and the team is focused on their specific 
tasks.

Levels of detail: Aggregates can also be useful for managing information at different levels of detail. For example, 
the User Stories aggregate can be used to document user needs and expectations regarding the product, while the 
Product Backlog can be used to prioritize and plan the activities necessary to meet those needs.

Ease of communication: The separation of aggregates can help facilitate communication and information sharing among the team.
Team members can focus on their specific tasks and have clear and accurate information in their own aggregate, 
without worrying about dealing with unnecessary or irrelevant information.

Flexibility: The use of two different aggregates can also provide more flexibility in project management. For example, 
if a team needs to focus more on User Stories to meet user needs, they can concentrate on that aggregate without being 
affected by other information that is not relevant to their specific task.

In summary, the creation of different aggregates can be justified by reasons of separation of responsibilities, 
levels of detail, ease of communication, and flexibility. By using the aggregates efficiently, it can help the team 
manage project information and activities more efficiently and meet user needs more effectively.

# Arguments

1. Clarity and simplicity of the domain model: By separating the domain model into two distinct aggregates, 
   it is possible to create a clearer and simpler structure. This can help reduce code complexity and make the domain 
   model easier to understand and maintain.

2. Reduced coupling: Separating the project and product backlog from the root user story can reduce coupling between 
   these entities. This can help ensure that changes to one entity do not unnecessarily affect the other, making system 
   maintenance and evolution easier.

3. Data consistency: Each aggregate should be treated as a transactional unit. By separating the project and product 
   backlog from the root user story into distinct aggregates, it is possible to ensure that transactions that affect 
   each of them are treated consistently and independently.

4. Scalability: Separating the domain model into two distinct aggregates can help improve the scalability of the system.
   Separating these entities can reduce the likelihood of conflicts and locks, improving system performance.

5. Facilitating system evolution: As the system evolves, it may be necessary to change or add new entities. Separating 
   the domain model into distinct aggregates can facilitate the addition of new entities and changes to the domain model,
   allowing the system to be more easily adaptable to the evolving needs of the business.
