This folder contains all artifacts related to the class domain model (according to DDD principles).

The Class Domain Model was developed taking into account the following DDD principles:

1) Identify Bounded Contexts: DDD emphasizes the importance of defining bounded contexts within a domain.
A bounded context is a specific area of the domain that has clear boundaries and a well-defined language.
The different contexts bounded in its domain must be identified and defined in terms of its ubiquitous language.

2) Define Aggregates: Within each limited context, aggregates should be identified.
An aggregate is a group of related entities that should be treated as a single unit of consistency.
Define the boundaries of aggregates and the rules for their interactions with other aggregates.

3) Model Entities and Value Objects: Define entities and value objects within each aggregate.
Entities represent objects with a unique identity that can change over time, while value objects represent objects without a unique identity that are immutable.
Use the ubiquitous language to define the attributes and behaviors of each entity and value object.

4) Identify domain services: domain services represent operations or processes that do not naturally fit within the boundaries of an aggregate.
Identify the domain services required by each bounded context and define them in terms of the ubiquitous language.

5) Define domain events: Domain events represent important occurrences within a domain that other parts of the system may need to respond to.
Identify the domain events that occur within each bounded context and define their structure and content.

6) Refine and iterate: As the DDD model is implemented, it needs to continue to be refined and iterated.
As the team gain a better understanding of the domain and how it interacts with the system, adjustments must be made to the model to reflect this new understanding.
